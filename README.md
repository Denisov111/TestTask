# TestTask

An application for calculating the salaries of employees separately and calculating the total salaries of all employees. 

For testing, you need to press the button "Сreate random employees", set the base rate, date for calculation and press "Сalc". 
Everything will be calculated and presented in the form of a table and a tree.

In practice, in order to expand in the future, of course, it was necessary to implement 3 classes:
Employees, Sales, Manager, make the Worker class abstract and inherit from it and place the salary calculation logic in them.
